# ImagoAI
This project uses hyperspectral imaging data to predict DON (Deoxynivalenol) levels in corn through a neural network model. It includes data preprocessing, visualization (spectral plots, heatmaps, PCA, t-SNE), model training with performance evaluation, and an interactive Streamlit app for real-time predictions on new data.
